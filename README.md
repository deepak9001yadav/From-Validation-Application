This is a simple form validation application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It demonstrates the ability to create and validate user input on forms before submission. The goal of this project is to ensure that the data entered into the form fields meets certain criteria, such as checking for required fields, valid email formats, and password strength.

Technologies Used
HTML: The markup language used to create the structure of the form.
CSS: Used to style the form and ensure it is visually appealing and user-friendly.
JavaScript: Handles the logic behind the form validation, ensuring that users input the correct data before submission.
Features
Input Validation: Ensures that all required fields are filled out and the data entered matches the expected format (e.g., valid email, strong password).
Custom Error Messages: Displays specific error messages for each validation failure, guiding users on how to correct their input.
Password Validation: Ensures that the password field meets a minimum length requirement and contains a mix of uppercase, lowercase letters, and special characters for enhanced security.
Real-Time Feedback: Provides immediate feedback to users as they fill out the form, making it easier for them to identify and fix any errors.
